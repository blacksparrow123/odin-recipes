    <h2>Descripstion</h2>
    <p>Just imagine a cute display of penguins, made with black olives, carrots and cream cheese!</p>
    <p>You can add scarves and hats by using fresh red pepper strips, or canned pimentos cut into different shapes.</p>
    <p>Use frilly toothpicks if you can.</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>18 jumbo black olives, pitted</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>18 small black olives</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a slit lengthwise (from top to bottom) into one side of each jumbo olive.
            Carefully insert about 1 teaspoon cream cheese into slits in each jumbo olive.</li>

        <li>Slice carrot into 18 1/4-inch-thick rounds; cut a small (pie-shaped) notch out of each carrot slice to form feet.
            Save the cut out pieces; press pieces into centers of small olives to form beaks.
            If necessary cut a small slit into each small olive before inserting the beak.</li>

        <li>Set a jumbo olive, large hole side down, onto a carrot slice.
            Then, set a small olive onto the jumbo olive, adjusting so that the beak, cream cheese chest, and notch in the carrot (feet) slice line up.
            Secure with a toothpick.</li>
    </ol>
